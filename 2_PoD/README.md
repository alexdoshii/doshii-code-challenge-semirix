# Challenge #2: PoD (aka. Pyramid of Death)

We love callbacks at Doshii!

Sorry. That was a lie. We use Promises where possible here.

## Problem

This task is about converting a "Pyramid of Doom/Death" or "Callback Hell" or whatever you like to call it, into promises.

The file is `pyramid.js` and well... Things aren't pretty in there.

## The Dataset

The data is powered by <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/" target="_blank">JSON Placeholder</a>. It's a bunch of fake data representing a social network.

## Testing Your Solution

There is a spec written in order to test the result has the required properties present.

Just run `yarn test`

## The Rules

Feel free to use any tool, library etc. at your disposal to find the solution. The only restrictions are that you cannot amend the tests.
