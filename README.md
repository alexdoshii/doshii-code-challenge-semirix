## Doshii Code Challenge - Web Application

Create a simple Dockerised application to manage members and rewards. The model for members and rewards are entirely up to you.
The application can be written in either JavaScript or TypeScript with a framework of your choosing.
The data can be stored in any source using an existing Docker container image.

### Must have:
The Nodejs application containing endpoints to manage CRUD operations:
- Members
  - Retrieve a member by email
  - Option to include associated rewards in the response
  - Option to specify which member properties to return
- Rewards
- Associate/dissociate a reward to a member

### Nice to have:
- Ability to search members
- Ability to search rewards
- Supporting unit and integration tests

#### A complete solution should have the following:
- NodeJS applicaiton
- An SQL/noSQL database
- Runnable in a Docker container

#### As part of your solution please specify any:
 - Software requirements
 - Installation instructions
 - Assumptions made about the requirements of the task
 - Anything you believe is important but out of scope or unnecessary

#### We value
 - Good application design
 - Clear and readable code
 - Tests and testable code
 - Decent performance

We would prefer if you created a publicly available repository for the completed work.
