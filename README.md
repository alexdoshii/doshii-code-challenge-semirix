# Doshii Code Challenge

There are three parts to the Code Challenge that you'll need to complete.
- Code Tests
- Questionnaire
- A Super Small Web App

Best to start by forking this repo

## Code Tests

A Doshii staff member will assign two of the tests located in this repo to you. Generally the idea is to modify the code so that the tests pass. Greater detail as to what is expected is located in each test subdirectory. Please contact <a href="mailto:info@dohsii.io">Jimmy</a> if the two tests have not been assigned.

## Questionnaire

Please answer the questions provided in the file `questionairre/README.md`

## A Super Small Web App

Doshii recently released a Rewards section of the API. Create a simple CRUD application with a Rewards theme using the following technologies
- NodeJS (ES6)
- An SQL flavour

As part of your solution please specify any:
 - Software requirements
 - Installation instructions
 - Assumptions made about the requirements of the task
 - Anything you believe is important but out of scope or unnecessary

We value:
 - Good application design
 - Clear and readable code
 - Tests and testable code
 - Decent performance

We would prefer if you created a publicly available repository for the completed work.
