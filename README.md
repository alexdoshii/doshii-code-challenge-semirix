## Questionnaire

Please answer the questions provided in the file `questionnaire/README.md`

## A Small Web Application

Create a simple Dockerised application to manage members and rewards. The model for members and rewards are entirely up to you.

#### As part of your solution please specify any:
 - Software requirements
 - Installation instructions
 - Assumptions made about the requirements of the task
 - Anything you believe is important but out of scope or unnecessary

#### We value
 - Good application design
